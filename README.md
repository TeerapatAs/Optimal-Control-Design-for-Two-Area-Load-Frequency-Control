# Optimal-Control-Design-for-Two-Area-Load-Frequency-Control
Implemented the control parameter and design terminology from I.J. Nagrath, D.P. Kothari, R.C. Desai, Modern power system analysis, third edition. McGraw-Hill (2003)

## Summary
An extended power system can be divided into a number of load control areas interconnected by tie lines.

This post considers a two-area case, connected by a single tie line. The system in one area has step load changes ($\delta P_{D1}$) of 0.01 pu.

To design an optimal control for a two-area system. The signal generated by the integral control from the two-area system is used as control inputs u1 and u2.
By using the LQR controller, the optimal control requires that the steady state values of system states and control input vectors have to be 0 for the cost function to have a minimum.
