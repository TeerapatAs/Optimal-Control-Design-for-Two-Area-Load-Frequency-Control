# Optimal-Control-Design-for-Two-Area-Load-Frequency-Control
Implemented the control parameter and design terminology from I.J. Nagrath, D.P. Kothari, R.C. Desai, Modern power system analysis, third edition. McGraw-Hill (2003)

## Summary
An extended power system can be divided into a number of load control areas interconnected by tie lines.

This post considers a two-area case, connected by a single tie line. The system in one area has step load changes ($\Delta P_{D1}$) of 0.01 pu.

To design an optimal control for a two-area system. The signal generated by the integral control from the two-area system is used as control inputs u1 and u2.
By using the LQR controller, the optimal control requires that the steady state values of system states and control input vectors have to be 0 for the cost function to have a minimum.

The state variables and input signals are shown in the picture **"State Space model.png"**

## File descriptions:
1. Algorithm to determine the abscissa of stability and the approximate peak output of the signal from a consistent input (load demand) that varies over time.
2. Simulink model of the Load Frequency Control (LFC) system. Run "for_simulink_model.m" first to set parameter values.
3. Senior_Project_Proposal_Edited.pdf - Shows that the designed regulator reduces the frequency deviation's peak to 50% from regulation limits under very high demand changes up to 8.4% pu/min while operating a reheat steam turbine with a ramp rate of up to 10% pu/min.
4. call_Algorithm1_TChuman_turbine.m - Used to compute the parameters of the regulator by calling the "Algorithm1_TChuman.m" function with the MBP Algorithm.
5. for_simulink_model.m - Script to initialize parameters for the LFC Simulink model.
